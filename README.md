# ImageBR
 the first implant and mammary gland segmentation dataset for surgical planning of breast reconstruction based on MRI images

 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the female population globally, and reconstructive breast surgery
has been widely adopted to improve the quality of life for
patients who have undergone mastectomy. One of the most
popular techniques in reconstructive breast surgery is implant-
based reconstruction, in which segmentation of implant and
mammary glands are critical for surgical planning. Recently,
segmentation of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
been widely used for implant segmentation and evaluation. How-
ever, most of the existing works focus on manual segmentation
or semi-automatic segmentation, and automatic segmentation
and evaluation of the implant and mammary gland are rarely
explored. In this paper, we propose ImageBR, the first implant
and mammary gland segmentation dataset for surgical planning
of breast reconstruction based on MRI images. ImageBR contains
44 MRI images which are labelled by a team of four experienced
surgeons from Department of Breast Oncology with segmentation
labels including implant and mammary gland. Particularly, the
implant is labeled in the MRI images based on clinical knowledge
which can possibly best fit the actual implant. We also present a
baseline method with anatomical prior integration and weighted
loss optimization for automatic implant and mammary gland
segmentation. Results show that the baseline framework can
achieve a segmentation accuracy of 83.0% and 74.4%, and there
is still big room for further improvement. We hope that ImageBR
can stimulate further research and lead to innovative and generic
solutions that would have an impact in multiple domains. Our
dataset and code are released to the public.
